# 🌦️ Climate–Pest Interaction Modeling

This project aims to model and analyze how climatic variables influence pest population dynamics using statistical and machine learning techniques. The objective is to identify key climate factors affecting pest outbreaks and predict pest occurrence trends under changing environmental conditions.

## 📘 Overview

The notebook explores the relationship between climatic indicators (such as temperature, humidity, and rainfall) and pest activity levels. It includes data preprocessing, feature selection, exploratory analysis, and predictive modeling to understand and quantify climate–pest interactions.

## ⚙️ Features

+ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing and inconsistent climate and pest data.

+ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing trends and correlations between climate variables and pest counts.

+ Model Building: Regression and machine learning models to predict pest population based on climate factors.

+ Model Evaluation: Performance comparison using metrics such as RMSE, R², and cross-validation.

+ Interpretation: Identifying the most influential climatic variables driving pest behavior.
